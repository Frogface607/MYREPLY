- New /api/referral endpoint: generates unique referral links, tracks clicks with IP dedup
- Bonus thresholds: 3 clicks = +5 responses, 10 = +15, 25 = 7d Start, 50 = 14d Start
- Challenge page: tracks ?ref= visits, shows referral panel for authenticated users
- Dashboard: referral link widget with stats and next reward progress
- Share functions use personalized referral URLs when available
- SQL migration for referral_links, referral_visits, referral_bonuses tables
